# LUAX Os

Luax os is an ultra simple operating system, it has no memory management, although I did it in two days.

With luax os you can interact with the sound blaster 16 sound card, for this is just put the sound command.


Besides that you have the print command (same as linux echo).

And the clear command that clears the screen.
